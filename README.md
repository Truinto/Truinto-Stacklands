Simple Farm
-----------
Makes it so gardens and farms keep their crop (like greenhouses). It will only throw out the extra crop.

Additionally:
- crops like apples produce apples, instead of apple trees
- foil cards stay foiled
- greenhouse produce 3 cards, if food value is 1
- sticks produce stick and tree
